âœ¨ Bitsquatting is a form of cybersquatting which relies on bit-flip errors that occur during the process of making a DNS request.

This repository contains a script to generate bit-flips for a single domain, query GoDaddy to check the availability, and return the results. Eventually, a DNS responder to implement on a server which a bit-flipped domain is pointed to will exist.
